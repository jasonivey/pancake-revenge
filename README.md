# Pancake Revenge

The following project is my Python implementation of the [Revenge of the Pancakes Challenge](Revenge of the Pancakes - Weave Take Home Challenge.pdf).  I have included three different input files to use as a test for the script.

1. input.txt
2. B-small-practice.in
3. B-large-practice.in

The first can be verified with the PDF linked above.  The second two can be verified using the Google Code Jam Revenge of the Pancakes dashboard.

The script can be run using either python2 or python3 with the following command:

```sh
python3 pancake_revenge.py < input.txt > output.txt
```
